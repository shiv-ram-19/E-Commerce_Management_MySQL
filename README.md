Project Description
This repository contains a comprehensive E-commerce Data Management System built with MySQL. The project focuses on architecting a robust relational database that mirrors real-world retail operations—moving beyond simple data storage to implement automated business logic and advanced analytical reporting.

Core Functionalities:
Automated Inventory & Integrity: Utilizes Database Triggers to manage real-time stock deductions and data validation (e.g., automated loyalty point initialization).

Advanced Analytics: Implements Window Functions (RANK), Subqueries, and Pivoting to identify high-value customer segments and top-performing products.

Encapsulated Logic: Features Stored Procedures with IN/OUT parameters to streamline complex operations like customer lifetime value calculations and order history retrieval.

Relational Architecture: A fully normalized schema ensuring referential integrity across Users, Orders, Products, and Payments.
